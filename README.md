The To Do List application is an example project of some of the skills I have in Android development.
It will eventually be available on the Google Play Store, possibly with ads. The application itself allows
users to create different items, with types of: Meeting, Shopping, Homework, Workout, and Chores. Each item
will have a priority of high, medium, or low. Each item is also color coordinated based on type and priority.
Each different type of to do has a details activity that allows specific information based on type of to do.

I am working on this application in my free time and I expect it to take a couple months until it is finished.
